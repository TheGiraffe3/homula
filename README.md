# Homula

Adds more ships for [Endless Sky](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky): the Hauler IV and the Eyrie.

The Hauler IV is a Hauler III that has been slightly expanded. The Eyrie continues the Nest/Roost/Skein line.

There is cross-plugin compatibility with [Blended Ships](https://github.com/mOctave/blended-ships).

Assets can be found [here](https://github.com/TheGiraffe3/homula-rumskib-assets).
